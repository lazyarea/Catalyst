.SH "NAME"
Catalyst::Manual::Deployment::nginx::FastCGI \- Deploying Catalyst with nginx
.SH "nginx"
.IX Header "nginx"
Catalyst runs under nginx via FastCGI in a similar fashion as the lighttpd
standalone server.
.PP
nginx does not have its own internal FastCGI process manager, so you must run
the FastCGI service separately.
.SS "Configuration"
.IX Subsection "Configuration"
To configure nginx, you must configure the FastCGI parameters and also the
socket your FastCGI daemon is listening on.  It can be either a \s-1TCP\s0 socket
or a Unix file socket.
.PP
The server configuration block should look roughly like:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    server {
\&        listen $port;
\&
\&        location / {
\&            fastcgi_param  QUERY_STRING       $query_string;
\&            fastcgi_param  REQUEST_METHOD     $request_method;
\&            fastcgi_param  CONTENT_TYPE       $content_type;
\&            fastcgi_param  CONTENT_LENGTH     $content_length;
\&
\&            fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_NAME        \*(Aq\*(Aq;
\&            fastcgi_param  PATH_INFO          $fastcgi_script_name;
\&            fastcgi_param  REQUEST_URI        $request_uri;
\&            fastcgi_param  DOCUMENT_URI       $document_uri;
\&            fastcgi_param  DOCUMENT_ROOT      $document_root;
\&            fastcgi_param  SERVER_PROTOCOL    $server_protocol;
\&
\&            fastcgi_param  GATEWAY_INTERFACE  CGI/1.1;
\&            fastcgi_param  SERVER_SOFTWARE    nginx/$nginx_version;
\&
\&            fastcgi_param  REMOTE_ADDR        $remote_addr;
\&            fastcgi_param  REMOTE_PORT        $remote_port;
\&            fastcgi_param  SERVER_ADDR        $server_addr;
\&            fastcgi_param  SERVER_PORT        $server_port;
\&            fastcgi_param  SERVER_NAME        $server_name;
\&
\&            # Adjust the socket for your applications!
\&            fastcgi_pass   unix:$docroot/myapp.socket;
\&        }
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
It is the standard convention of nginx to include the fastcgi_params in a
separate file (usually something like \f(CW\*(C`/etc/nginx/fastcgi_params\*(C'\fR) and
simply include that file.
.PP
If you include the \f(CW\*(C`/etc/nginx/fastcgi_params\*(C'\fR that comes with your
distribution, e.g. Debian, you need to adjust a couple of parameters for \s-1PSGI\s0
compatibility, use something like this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
\&        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_NAME \*(Aq\*(Aq;
\&        fastcgi_param PATH_INFO   $fastcgi_script_name;
.Ve
.SS "Non-root configuration"
.IX Subsection "Non-root configuration"
If you properly specify the \s-1PATH_INFO\s0 and \s-1SCRIPT_NAME\s0 parameters your
application will be accessible at any path. The \s-1SCRIPT_NAME\s0 variable is the
prefix of your application, and \s-1PATH_INFO\s0 would be everything in addition.
.PP
As an example, if your application is rooted at /myapp, you would configure:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    rewrite ^/myapp$ /myapp/ permanent;
\&    location /myapp/ {
\&        include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
\&        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_NAME /myapp/;
\&        fastcgi_param PATH_INFO   $fastcgi_script_name;
\&        fastcgi_pass unix:/tmp/myapp.socket;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW$fastcgi_script_name\fR would be \*(L"/myapp/path/of/the/action\*(R".  Catalyst will
process this accordingly and setup the application base as expected.
.PP
This behavior is somewhat different from Apache and lighttpd, but is still
functional.
.PP
Note that the rewrite may not be needed with newer versions of nginx,
and the paths must be exactly as specified \- the trailing slash in the
location block and the \s-1SCRIPT_NAME\s0 are important.
.SS "\s-1SSL\s0"
.IX Subsection "SSL"
Make sure that nginx passes this to your fastcgi. To ensure this, you need
the following in your nginx config for the \s-1SSL\s0 vhost:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    fastcgi_param  HTTPS on
