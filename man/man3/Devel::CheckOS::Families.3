.SH "NAME"
Devel::CheckOS::Families \- what OS "families" are supported "out of the
box" by Devel::CheckOS and Devel::AssertOS?
.SH "WHAT IS AN OS FAMILY"
.IX Header "WHAT IS AN OS FAMILY"
Computing platforms fall into several categories.  For example, there is
the category of Unix-a-likes.  Each of these categories is a \*(L"family\*(R".
A platform can fall into several families.
.SH "THE Unix FAMILY"
.IX Header "THE Unix FAMILY"
Broadly speaking, these are platforms where:
.IP "Devices are represented as pseudo-files in the filesystem" 4
.IX Item "Devices are represented as pseudo-files in the filesystem"
.PD 0
.IP "Symlinks and hardlinks are supported in at least some filesystems" 4
.IX Item "Symlinks and hardlinks are supported in at least some filesystems"
.ie n .IP """Unix-style"" permissions are supported" 4
.el .IP "``Unix-style'' permissions are supported" 4
.IX Item "Unix-style permissions are supported"
.PD
That is, there are seperate read/write/execute permissions for file owner,
group and anyone.  This implies the presence of multiple user accounts
and user groups.  Permissions may not be supported on all filesystems.
.IP "The filesystem has a single root" 4
.IX Item "The filesystem has a single root"
.PD 0
.IP "The C \s-1API\s0 for the operating system is largely POSIX-compatible" 4
.IX Item "The C API for the operating system is largely POSIX-compatible"
.PD
.SH "THE Linux FAMILY"
.IX Header "THE Linux FAMILY"
This includes both ordinary Linux and Android. Plain old Linux will
match 'Linux'. Android will match both that and 'Android'.
.SH "THE MicrosoftWindows FAMILY"
.IX Header "THE MicrosoftWindows FAMILY"
This includes any version of Windows and also includes things like
Cygwin which run on top of it.
.SH "THE DEC, Sun, and Apple FAMILIES"
.IX Header "THE DEC, Sun, and Apple FAMILIES"
These include any \s-1OS\s0 written by, respectively, \s-1DEC\s0, Sun, and Apple.
They exist because, while, eg, Mac \s-1OS\s0 Classic and Mac \s-1OS\s0 X are very
different platforms, they do support some unique features \- such as
AppleScript.
.SH "THE Realtime FAMILY"
.IX Header "THE Realtime FAMILY"
This is for all real-time OSes.  So far, it only includes \s-1QNX\s0.
.SH "THE EBCDIC FAMILY"
.IX Header "THE EBCDIC FAMILY"
OSes which use \s-1EBCDIC\s0 instead of \s-1ASCII\s0.
.SH "AUTHOR, COPYRIGHT and LICENCE"
.IX Header "AUTHOR, COPYRIGHT and LICENCE"
