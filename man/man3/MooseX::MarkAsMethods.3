.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
MooseX::MarkAsMethods allows one to easily mark certain functions as Moose
methods.  This will allow other packages such as namespace::autoclean to
operate without blowing away your overloads.  After using
MooseX::MarkAsMethods your overloads will be recognized by Class::MOP as
being methods, and class extension as well as composition from roles with
overloads will \*(L"just work\*(R".
.PP
By default we check for overloads, and mark those functions as methods.
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`autoclean =&gt; 1\*(C'\fR is passed to import on using this module, we will invoke
namespace::autoclean to clear out non-methods.
.SH "TRAITS APPLIED"
.IX Header "TRAITS APPLIED"
Using this package causes a trait to be applied to your metaclass (for both
roles and classes), that provides a \fImark_as_method()\fR method.  You can use this
to mark newly generated methods at runtime (e.g. during class composition)
that some other package has created for you.
.PP
\&\fImark_as_method()\fR is invoked with one or more names to mark as a method.  We die
on any error (e.g. name not in symbol table, already a method, etc).  e.g.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->meta\->mark_as_method(\*(Aqnewly_generated\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
e.g. say you have some sugar from another package that creates accessors of
some sort; you could mark them as methods via a method modifier:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # called as _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->foo_generator(\*(Aqname\*(Aq, ...)
\&    after \*(Aqfoo_generator\*(Aq => sub {
\&
\&        shift\->meta\->mark_as_method(shift);
\&    };
.Ve
.SH "IMPLICATIONS FOR ROLES"
.IX Header "IMPLICATIONS FOR ROLES"
Using MooseX::MarkAsMethods in a role will cause Moose to track and treat your
overloads like any other method defined in the role, and things will \*(L"just
work\*(R".  That's it.
.PP
Except...  note that due to the way overloads, roles, and Moose work, you'll
need to use the coderef or anonymous subroutine approach to overload
declaration, or things will not work as you expect.  Remember, we're talking
about _methods_ here, so we need to make it easy for overload to find
the right method.  The easiest (and supported) way to do this is to create an
anonymous sub to wrap the overload method.
.PP
That is, this will work:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # note method resolution, things will "just work"
\&    use overload \*(Aq""\*(Aq => sub { shift\->stringify };
.Ve
.PP
\&...and this will not:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use overload \*(Aq""\*(Aq => \*(Aqstringify\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
\&...and will result in an error message like:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # wah\-wah
\&    Can\*(Aqt resolve method "???" overloading """" in package "overload"

.SH "CAVEATS"
.IX Header "CAVEATS"
.SS "Roles"
.IX Subsection "Roles"
See the \*(L"\s-1IMPLICATIONS\s0 \s-1FOR\s0 \s-1ROLES\s0\*(R" section, above.
.SS "meta\->\fImark_as_method()\fP"
.IX Subsection "meta->mark_as_method()"
\&\fBYou almost certainly don't need or want to do this.\fR  CMOP/Moose are fairly
good about determining what is and what isn't a method, but not perfect.
Before using this method, you should pause and think about why you need to.
.SS "namespace::autoclean"
.IX Subsection "namespace::autoclean"
As currently implemented, we run our \*(L"method maker\*(R" at the end of the calling
package's compile scope (B::Hooks::EndOfScope).  As namespace::autoclean
does the same thing, it's important that if namespace::autoclean is used that
it be used \s-1BEFORE\s0 MooseX::MarkAsMethods, so that its end_of_scope block is
run after ours.
.PP
e.g.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # yes!
\&    use namespace::autoclean;
\&    use MooseX::MarkAsMethods;
\&
\&    # no \-\- overloads will be removed
\&    use MooseX::MarkAsMethods;
\&    use namespace::autoclean;
.Ve
.PP
The easiest way to invoke this module and clean out non-methods without having
to worry about ordering is:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use MooseX::MarkAsMethods autoclean => 1;

MooseX::Role::WithOverloading does allow for overload application from

roles, but it does this by copying the overload symbols from the (not
