.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Moose::Autobox provides an implementation of \s-1SCALAR\s0, \s-1ARRAY\s0, \s-1HASH\s0
& \s-1CODE\s0 for use with autobox. It does this using a hierarchy of 
roles in a manner similar to what Perl 6 \fImight\fR do. This module, 
like Class::MOP and Moose, was inspired by my work on the 
Perl 6 Object Space, and the 'core types' implemented there.
.SS "A quick word about autobox"
.IX Subsection "A quick word about autobox"
The autobox module provides the ability for calling 'methods' 
on normal Perl values like Scalars, Arrays, Hashes and Code 
references. This gives the illusion that Perl's types are first-class 
objects. However, this is only an illusion, albeit a very nice one.
I created this module because autobox itself does not actually 
provide an implementation for the Perl types but instead only provides 
the 'hooks' for others to add implementation too.
.SS "Is this for real? or just play?"
.IX Subsection "Is this for real? or just play?"
Several people are using this module in serious applications and 
it seems to be quite stable. The underlying technologies of autobox
and Moose::Role are also considered stable. There is some performance
hit, but as I am fond of saying, nothing in life is free.  Note that this hit
only applies to the \fIuse\fR of methods on native Perl values, not the mere act
of loading this module in your namespace.
.PP
If you have any questions regarding this module, either email me, or stop by
#moose on irc.perl.org and ask around.
.SS "Adding additional methods"
.IX Subsection "Adding additional methods"
\&\fBMoose::Autobox\fR asks autobox to use the \fBMoose::Autobox::*\fR namespace 
prefix so as to avoid stepping on the toes of other autobox modules. This 
means that if you want to add methods to a particular perl type 
(i.e. \- monkeypatch), then you must do this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sub Moose::Autobox::SCALAR::bar { 42 }
.Ve
.PP
instead of this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sub SCALAR::bar { 42 }
.Ve
.PP
as you would with vanilla autobox.

.el .IP "\fBmixin_additional_role ($type, \f(CB$role\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "mixin_additional_role ($type, $role)"
This will mixin an additional \f(CW$role\fR into a certain \f(CW$type\fR. The 
types can be \s-1SCALAR\s0, \s-1ARRAY\s0, \s-1HASH\s0 or \s-1CODE\s0.

This can be used to add additional methods to the types, see the 
\&\fIexamples/units/\fR directory for some examples.
