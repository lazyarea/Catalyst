.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Devel::StackTrace is pretty good at generating stack traces.
.PP
PadWalker is pretty good at the inspection and modification of your callers'
lexical variables.
.PP
Devel::StackTrace::WithLexicals is pretty good at generating stack traces
with all your callers' lexical variables.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
All the same as Devel::StackTrace, except that frames (in class
Devel::StackTrace::WithLexicals::Frame) also have a \f(CW\*(C`lexicals\*(C'\fR method. This
returns the same hashref as returned by PadWalker.
.PP
Unless the \f(CW\*(C`unsafe_ref_capture\*(C'\fR option to Devel::StackTrace is
used, then each reference is stringified. This can be useful to avoid
leaking memory.
.PP
Simple, really.

.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
I had to copy and paste some code from Devel::StackTrace to achieve this
(it's hard to subclass). There may be bugs lingering here.
