.SH "NAME"
Catalyst::Delta \- Overview of changes between versions of Catalyst
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This is an overview of the user-visible changes to Catalyst between major
Catalyst releases.
.SS "\s-1VERSION\s0 5.90060+"
.IX Subsection "VERSION 5.90060+"
\fICatalyst::Log object autoflush on by default\fR
.IX Subsection "Catalyst::Log object autoflush on by default"
.PP
Starting in 5.90065, the Catalyst::Log object has 'autoflush' which is on
by default. This causes all messages to be written to the log immediately
instead of at the end of startup and then at the end of each request. In
order to access the old behavior, you must now call:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $c\->log\->autoflush(0);
.Ve
.PP
\fIDeprecate Catalyst::Utils::ensure_class_loaded\fR
.IX Subsection "Deprecate Catalyst::Utils::ensure_class_loaded"
.PP
Going forward we recommend you use Module::Runtime.  In fact we will
be converting all uses of Class::Load to Module::Runtime.  We will
also convert Catalyst::Utils\eensure_class_loaded to be based on
Module::Runtime to allow some time for you to update code, however at
some future point this method will be removed so you should stop
using it now.
.PP
\fISupport passing Body filehandles directly to your Plack server.\fR
.IX Subsection "Support passing Body filehandles directly to your Plack server."
.PP
We changed the way we return body content (from response) to whatever
Plack handler you are using (Starman, FastCGI, etc.)  We no longer
always use the streaming interface for the cases when the body is a
simple scalar, object or filehandle like.  In those cases we now just
pass the simple response on to the plack handler.  This might lead to
some minor differences in how streaming is handled.  For example, you
might notice that streaming starts properly supporting chunked encoding when
on a server that supports that, or that previously missing headers
(possible content-length) might appear suddenly correct.  Also, if you
are using middleware like Plack::Middleware::XSendfile and are using
a filehandle that sets a readable path, your server might now correctly
handle the file (rather than as before where Catalyst would stream it
very likely very slowly).
.PP
In other words, some things might be meaninglessly different and some
things that were broken codewise but worked because of Catalyst being
incorrect might suddenly be really broken.  The behavior is now more
correct in that Catalyst plays better with features that Plack offers
but if you are making heavy use of the streaming interface there could
be some differences so you should test carefully (this is probably not
the vast majority of people).  In particular if you are developing
using one server but deploying using a different one, differences in
what those server do with streaming should be noted.
.PP
Please see note below about changes to filehandle support and existing
Plack middleware to aid in backwards compatibility.
.PP
\fIDistinguish between body null versus undef.\fR
.IX Subsection "Distinguish between body null versus undef."
.PP
We also now more carefully distingush the different between a body set
to '' and a body that is undef.  This might lead to situations where
again you'll get a content-length were you didn't get one before or
where a supporting server will start chunking output.  If this is an
issue you can apply the middleware Plack::Middleware::BufferedStreaming
or report specific problems to the dev team.
.PP
\fIMore Catalyst Middleware\fR
.IX Subsection "More Catalyst Middleware"
.PP
We have started migrating code in Catalyst to equivilent Plack
Middleware when such exists and is correct to do so.  For example we now use
Plack::Middleware::ContentLength to determine content length of a response
when none is provided.  This replaces similar code inlined with Catalyst
The main advantages to doing this is 1) more similar Catalyst core that is 
focused on the Catalyst special sauce, 2) Middleware is more broadly shared
so we benefit from better collaboration with developers outside Catalyst, 3)
In the future you'll be able to change or trim the middleware stack to get
additional performance when you don't need all the checks and constraints.
.PP
\fIDeprecate Filehandle like objects that do read but not getline\fR
.IX Subsection "Deprecate Filehandle like objects that do read but not getline"
.PP
We also deprecated setting the response body to an object that does 'read'
but not 'getline'.  If you are using a custom IO-Handle like object for
response you should verify that 'getline' is supported in your interface.
Unless we here this case is a major issue for people, we will be removing support
in a near future release of Catalyst.  When the code encounters this it
will issue a warning.  You also may run into this issue with MogileFS::Client
which does read but not getline.  For now we will just warn when encountering
such an object and fallback to the previous behavior (where Catalyst::Engine
itself unrolls the filehandle and performs blocking streams).  However
this backwards compatibility will be removed in an upcoming release so you should either
rewrite your custom filehandle objects to support getline or start using the 
middleware that adapts read for getline Plack::Middleware::AdaptFilehandleRead.
.PP
\fIResponse\->headers become read-only after finalizing\fR
.IX Subsection "Response->headers become read-only after finalizing"
.PP
Once the response headers are finalized, trying to change them is not allowed
(in the past you could change them and this would lead to unexpected results).
.PP
\fIOfficially deprecate Catalyst::Engine::PSGI\fR
.IX Subsection "Officially deprecate Catalyst::Engine::PSGI"
.PP
Catalyst::Engine::PSGI is also officially no longer supported.  We will
no long run test cases against this and can remove backwards compatibility code for it
as deemed necessary for the evolution of the platform.  You should simply
discontinue use of this engine, as Catalyst has been \s-1PSGI\s0 at the core for
several years.
.PP
\fIOfficially deprecate finding the \s-1PSGI\s0 \f(CI$env\fI anyplace other than Request\fR
.IX Subsection "Officially deprecate finding the PSGI $env anyplace other than Request"
.PP
A few early releases of Cataplack had the \s-1PSGI\s0 \f(CW$env\fR in Catalyst::Engine.
Code has been maintained here for backwards compatibility reasons.  This is no
longer supported and will be removed in upcoming release, so you should update
your code and / or upgrade to a newer version of Catalyst
.PP
\fIDeprecate setting Response\->body after using write/write_fh\fR
.IX Subsection "Deprecate setting Response->body after using write/write_fh"
.PP
Setting \f(CW$c\fR\->res\->body to a filehandle after using \f(CW$c\fR\->res\->write or
\&\f(CW$c\fR\->res\->write_fh is no longer considered allowed, since we can't send
the filehandle to the underlying Plack handler.  For now we will continue
to support setting body to a simple value since this is possible, but at
some future release a choice to use streaming indicates that you will do
so for the rest of the request.
.SS "\s-1VERSION\s0 5.90053"
.IX Subsection "VERSION 5.90053"
We are now clarifying the behavior of log, plugins and configuration during
the setup phase.  Since Plugins might require a log during setup, setup_log
must run \s-1BEFORE\s0 setup_plugins.   This has the unfortunate side effect that
anyone using the popular ConfigLoader plugin will not be able to supply
configuration to custom logs since the configuration is not yet finalized
when setup_log is run (when using ConfigLoader, which is a plugin and is
not loaded until later.)
.PP
As a workaround, you can supply custom log configuration directly into
the configuration:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    package MyApp;
\&    use Catalyst;
\&
\&    _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->config(
\&      my_custom_log_info => { %custom_args },
\&    );
\&
\&    _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->setup;
.Ve
.PP
If you wish to configure the custom logger differently based on \s-1ENV\s0, you can
try:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    package MyApp;
\&
\&    use Catalyst;
\&    use Catalyst::Utils;
\&
\&    _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->config(
\&      Catalyst::Utils::merge_hashes(
\&        +{ my_custom_log_info => { %base_custom_args } },
\&        +{ do _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->path_to( $ENV{WHICH_CONF}."_conf.pl") },
\&      ),
\&    );
\&
\&    _\|_PACKAGE_\|_\->setup;
.Ve
.PP
Or create a standalone Configuration class that does the right thing.
.PP
Basically if you want to configure a logger via Catalyst global configuration
you can't use ConfigLoader because it will always be loaded too late to be of
any use.  Patches and workaround options welcomed!
.SS "\s-1VERSION\s0 5.9XXXX 'cataplack'"
.IX Subsection "VERSION 5.9XXXX 'cataplack'"
The Catalyst::Engine sub-classes have all been removed and deprecated,
to be replaced with Plack handlers.
.PP
Plack is an implementation of the \s-1PSGI\s0 specification, which is
a standard interface between web servers and application frameworks.
.PP
This should be no different for developers, and you should not have to
migrate your applications unless you are using a custom engine already.
.PP
This change benefits Catalyst significantly by reducing the amount of
code inside the framework, and means that the framework gets upstream
bug fixes in Plack, and automatically gains support for any web server
which a \s-1PSGI\s0 compliant handler is written for.
.PP
It also allows you more flexibility with your application, and allows
the use of cross web framework 'middleware'.
.PP
Developers are recommended to read Catalyst::Upgrading for notes about
upgrading, especially if you are using an unusual deployment method.
.PP
Documentation for how to take advantage of \s-1PSGI\s0 can be found in
Catalyst::PSGI, and information about deploying your application
has been moved to Catalyst::Manual::Deployment.
.PP
\fIUpdated modules:\fR
.IX Subsection "Updated modules:"
.PP
A number of modules have been updated to pass their tests or not
produce deprecation warnings with the latest version of Catalyst.

This lets you pass the response object to functions that want to write to an 
IO::Handle.
.IP "\(bu" 4

.PP
\fIConsequences of the Moose back end\fR
.IX Subsection "Consequences of the Moose back end"
.IP "\(bu" 4
Components are fully compatible with Moose, and all Moose features, such as
method modifiers, attributes, roles, \s-1BUILD\s0 and \s-1BUILDARGS\s0 methods are fully
supported and may be used in components and applications.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Many reusable extensions which would previously have been plugins or base 
classes are better implemented as Moose roles.
.IP "\(bu" 4
MooseX::MethodAttributes::Role::AttrContainer::Inheritable is used to contain action
attributes. This means that attributes are represented in the \s-1MOP\s0, and
decouples action creation from attributes.
.IP "\(bu" 4
There is a reasonable \s-1API\s0 in Catalyst::Controller for working with
and registering actions, allowing a controller sub-class to replace
subroutine attributes for action declarations with an alternate
syntax.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Refactored capturing of \f(CW$app\fR from Catalyst::Controller into
Catalyst::Component::ApplicationAttribute for easier reuse in other
components.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Your application class is forced to become immutable at the end of compilation.
.PP
\fIBug fixes\fR
.IX Subsection "Bug fixes"
.IP "\(bu" 4
Don't ignore \s-1SIGCHLD\s0 while handling requests with the development server, so that
\&\fIsystem()\fR and other ways of creating child processes work as expected.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Fixes for FastCGI when used with \s-1IIS\s0 6.0
.IP "\(bu" 4
Fix a bug in uri_for which could cause it to generate paths with multiple 
slashes in them.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Fix a bug in Catalyst::Stats, stopping garbage being inserted into
the stats if a user calls begin => but no end
