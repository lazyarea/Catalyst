.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Throwable is a role for classes that are meant to be thrown as exceptions to
standard program flow.  It is very simple and does only two things: saves any
previous value for \f(CW$@\fR and calls \f(CW\*(C`die $self\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Throwable is implemented with Moo, so you can stick to Moo or use Moose
as you prefer.
.SH "ATTRIBUTES"
.IX Header "ATTRIBUTES"
.SS "previous_exception"
.IX Subsection "previous_exception"
This attribute is created automatically, and stores the value of \f(CW$@\fR when the
Throwable object is created.  This is done on a \fIbest effort basis\fR.  \f(CW$@\fR is
subject to lots of spooky action-at-a-distance.  For now, there are clearly
ways that the previous exception could be lost.

\&  Something::Throwable\->throw({ attr => $value });
.Ve
.PP
This method will call new, passing all arguments along to new, and will then
use the created object as the only argument to \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR.
.PP
If called on an object that does Throwable, the object will be rethrown.
