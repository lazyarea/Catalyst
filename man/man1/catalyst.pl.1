.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \f(CW\*(C`catalyst.pl\*(C'\fR script bootstraps a Catalyst application, creating a
directory structure populated with skeleton files.
.PP
The application name must be a valid Perl module name.  The name of the
directory created is formed from the application name supplied, with double
colons replaced with hyphens (so, for example, the directory for \f(CW\*(C`My::App\*(C'\fR is
\&\f(CW\*(C`My\-App\*(C'\fR).
.PP
Using the example application name \f(CW\*(C`My::App\*(C'\fR, the application directory will
contain the following items:
.IP "\s-1README\s0" 4
.IX Item "README"
a skeleton \s-1README\s0 file, which you are encouraged to expand on
.IP "Changes" 4
.IX Item "Changes"
a changes file with an initial entry for the creation of the application
.IP "Makefile.PL" 4
.IX Item "Makefile.PL"
Makefile.PL uses the \f(CW\*(C`Module::Install\*(C'\fR system for packaging and distribution
of the application.
.IP "lib" 4
.IX Item "lib"
contains the application module (\f(CW\*(C`My/App.pm\*(C'\fR) and
subdirectories for model, view, and controller components (\f(CW\*(C`My/App/M\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`My/App/V\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`My/App/C\*(C'\fR).
.IP "root" 4
.IX Item "root"
root directory for your web document content.  This is left empty.
.IP "script" 4
.IX Item "script"
a directory containing helper scripts:
.RS 4
.ie n .IP """myapp_create.pl""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWmyapp_create.pl\fR" 4
.IX Item "myapp_create.pl"
helper script to generate new component modules
.ie n .IP """myapp_server.pl""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWmyapp_server.pl\fR" 4
.IX Item "myapp_server.pl"
runs the generated application within a Catalyst test server, which can be
used for testing without resorting to a full-blown web server configuration.
.ie n .IP """myapp_cgi.pl""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWmyapp_cgi.pl\fR" 4
.IX Item "myapp_cgi.pl"
runs the generated application as a \s-1CGI\s0 script
.ie n .IP """myapp_fastcgi.pl""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWmyapp_fastcgi.pl\fR" 4
.IX Item "myapp_fastcgi.pl"
runs the generated application as a FastCGI script
.ie n .IP """myapp_test.pl""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWmyapp_test.pl\fR" 4
.IX Item "myapp_test.pl"
runs an action of the generated application from the command line.

.RS 4

.IP "t" 4
.IX Item "t"

.PP
The application module generated by the \f(CW\*(C`catalyst.pl\*(C'\fR script is functional,
although it reacts to all requests by outputting a friendly welcome screen.
.SH "NOTE"
.IX Header "NOTE"
Neither \f(CW\*(C`catalyst.pl\*(C'\fR nor the generated helper script will overwrite existing
files.  In fact the scripts will generate new versions of any existing files,
adding the extension \f(CW\*(C`.new\*(C'\fR to the filename.  The \f(CW\*(C`.new\*(C'\fR file is not created
if would be identical to the existing file.
.PP
This means you can re-run the scripts for example to see if newer versions of
Catalyst or its plugins generate different code, or to see how you may have
changed the generated code (although you do of course have all your code in a
version control system anyway, don't you ...).
