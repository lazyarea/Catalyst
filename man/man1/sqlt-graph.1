.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This script will create a graph of your schema.  Only the database
driver argument (for SQL::Translator) is required.  If no output file
name is given, then image will be printed to \s-1STDOUT\s0, so you should
redirect the output into a file.
.PP
The default action is to assume the presence of foreign key
relationships defined via \*(L"\s-1REFERNCES\s0\*(R" or \*(L"\s-1FOREIGN\s0 \s-1KEY\s0\*(R" constraints on
the tables.  If you are parsing the schema of a file that does not
have these, you will find the natural join options helpful.  With
natural joins, like-named fields will be considered foreign keys.
This can prove too permissive, however, as you probably don't want a
field called \*(L"name\*(R" to be considered a foreign key, so you could
include it in the \*(L"skip\*(R" option, and all fields called \*(L"name\*(R" will be
excluded from natural joins.  A more efficient method, however, might
be to simply deduce the foreign keys from primary keys to other fields
named the same in other tables.  Use the \*(L"natural-join-pk\*(R" option
to achieve this.
.PP
If the schema defines foreign keys, then the graph produced will be
directed showing the direction of the relationship.  If the foreign
keys are intuited via natural joins, the graph will be undirected.
.PP
Clustering of tables allows you to group and box tables according to
function or domain or whatever criteria you choose.  The syntax for
clustering tables is:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  cluster1=table1,table2;cluster2=table3,table4
